# Worm-eating-apple-game-FPGA

Design Project for Digital Logic Laboratory Class, Oct 2012 ~ Nov 2012.  
Designed by Jae Seung Won, Hyun Joon Chae

#1 Discription  
 The goal of this game is to eat apple as many as you can.  
 If the head of worm meats it's body, then it will die.  
 Used Quartus VHDL Program.
 There is Main part and Clock Control part and Ring Counter part( for making random num).  
 Three parts are change to block and then connected by wire ( Schemetic)  
 The kit was given ( Dotmatrix and Keypad also already installed in the kit)  
 It requires pin mapping during transfer to kit.
